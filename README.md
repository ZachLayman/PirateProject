# PirateProject

Project for Oakland OU, CSI 2999

We have decided to make a game that is a homage to classic Space Invaders. 
Our current working title is Pirate Pillagers. 
It is a game where you, the player, control a cannon to shoot cannonballs at pirate themed targets. 
By doing so, you get points and compete with others to beat their highscores. 
The main goal of our application is to provide quick entertainment for its users.  

Our team consists of the following members; 
Julia DuPont, Duy Hoang, Zach Layman, 
Jennifer Orlando, Dominic Smyth, and Christopher Wodkiewicz.
